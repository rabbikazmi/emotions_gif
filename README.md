# emotions_gif
GIFs are “animated images” because they aren’t exactly videos. They don't have sound but flip their images sequentially for a number of loops.
In this mini-mini project, I tried using Python's library "imageio" and created a gif with just "for" loop. 

#Steps to create your very own GIF
1. Firstly, save or create images you want to create gif with, I used my own digital drawings with simple emotions drawn on them.
2. Open cmd and type "pip install imageio", make sure you have python version already installed in your system.
3. open Vscode and make a new python script named of your choice with .py extension.
4. Write the python code and make sure to use Try and Except blocks to check if the gif has been successfully created or not.

Make sure your images and python script are in the same directory! If not, change directory.

Happy coding! <3
